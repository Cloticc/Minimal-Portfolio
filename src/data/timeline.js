            'I leveraged the power of the Eluna API and Lua programming language to design and implement a highly versatile shop interface. This interface offers users the ability to customize prices for various items using currencies such as gold, honor, and more. Additionally, I incorporated a quantity setup feature, allowing prices to dynamically adjust in real-time based on the desired quantity of items being purchased. Overcoming the challenges associated with integrating the Eluna API and Lua, I successfully developed a user-friendly and intuitive interface that significantly enhanced the overall user experience.
